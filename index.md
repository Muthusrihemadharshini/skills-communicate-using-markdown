## Understanding Markdown

### Why Markdown is useful
Markdown helps developers write clean, readable documentation that is easy to maintain.

### Where I use Markdown
- README files
- Pull request descriptions
- Issue discussions
- Project documentation

### What I am learning
I am learning how to use Markdown headers, lists, and formatting to communicate better in open source projects.


### Add sample content demonstrating Markdown headers


##  Added sample code

``` python
#PYTHON
a = 1
b = 2
c = a+b
print(c)
```
